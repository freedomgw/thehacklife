						About Me
					</h1>
					<p>
						Hey! Thanks for checking my website! I am interested in <span class="important">mobile</span> and <span class="important">web</span> development ranging from the front-end to the back-end development.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like most high school students, I wasn't entirely sure of who I wanted to be when I finished my study career. However, I knew from the start that I was interested in <span class="important">creating</span> things and I had little experience in programming. In the end, I chose computer science in one of the most prestigious  school that Canada has to offer, University of Waterloo.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am a fourth year <span style="color: orange;">computer science</span> student from the University of Waterloo in a five year co-operative program. During my studies in the University of Waterloo, I have learned that I have growing passion in creating software technology. These experiences were found through my five internships in both Canada and United States.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am excited to see what's in store in the <span style="color: green;">future</span>! In the meantime, I will keep coding away and will be blogging interesting experiences that I have found on my website.
					</p>
					<p>
						Cheers.
					</p>
